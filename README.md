# Filtering SQL Queries

## Objective

The following steps provide examples of how I used SQL with filters to perform security-related tasks. Such as, investigating protential security issues and filtering employee computers to update systems.

### Skills Learned

- Using SQL to find failed login attempts.
- Filtering to find time and dates of login attempts.
- Retrieving login attempts outside of a certin country.
- Filtering for employee information from specific departments in the organization.

### Tools Used

- MariaDB Shell to run SQL Queries.

## Steps
1) Retrieve after hours failed login attempts: There was a potential security incident that occurred after business hours (after 18:00). All after hours login attempts that failed need to be investigated.

2) Retrieve login attempts on specific dates: A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. Any login activity that happened on 2022-05-09 or on the day before needs to be investigated. The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for login attempts that occurred on specific dates.

3) Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico: After investigating the organizationâ€™s data on login attempts, I believe there is an issue with the login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. These login attempts should be investigated.

3) Retrieve employees in Marketing: My team wants to update the computers for certain employees in the Marketing department. To do this, I have to get information on which employee machines to update.

4) Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales: The machines for employees in the Finance and Sales departments also need to be updated. Since a different security update is needed, I have to get information on employees only from these two departments.

5) Retrieve all employees not in IT: My team needs to make one more security update on employees who are not in the Information Technology department. To make the update, I first have to get information on these employees.
